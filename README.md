# MinimumErrorRateClassifier
Bayesian decision theory is important in statistics and are
often used to represent real-valued random variables whose
distributions are not known.It enables us to predict the error
we will get when we generalize to novel patterns.The Bayes
Theory helps to calculate the Posterior probability(which is
an conditional probability) of an unknown variable with the
help of Likelihood probability, Prior probability and Evidence.

We were given some data that includes a test data,
mean, sigma and prior.We distributed the given data into two
classes using the Minimum Error Rate Classifier. We calculated
the likelihood probabilities using the Multivariate Normal Density Function.I plotted them along with the decision boundary in
a 3D surface.
